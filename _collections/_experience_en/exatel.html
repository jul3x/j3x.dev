A telecommunications company also involved in cybersecurity and R&D.
I joined as a Senior Software Engineer for the TAMA project - a scalable
and high-performance distributed Anti-DDoS system.
After six months, I took on the role of Lead Developer for the project
and contributed to shaping its further development.<br/><br/>

I specialized in implementing low-level system components (those at the network interface)
requiring efficient memory management and often creative problem-solving approaches.
It was necessary to maintain high performance
and low-latency characteristics while implementing new,
secure code supporting new network protocols and features.
The work demanded close attention and frequent use of low-level tools
(assembler, profiler, fuzzer).<br/><br/>

During my work in TAMA project, I also developed the core of the system, a horizontally scalable cluster
processing data coming from edge units. I created complex user interfaces showing the network state
in real-time and handled integrations with other internal systems.<br/><br/>

I led the release and deployment process for production environments,
which involved actively monitoring code quality
(code reviews, automated unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, CI/CD),
manual testing processes, and synchronization of work between teams.
I prepared new system versions and seamless deployment steps (partially automated).
My responsibility was also to recruit new team members.<br/><br/>

During my time at TAMA, my team successfully completed
the full development of a new system that protects against application-layer (L7) attacks.
