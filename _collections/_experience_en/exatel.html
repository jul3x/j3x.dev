A telecommunications company also involved in&nbsp;cybersecurity and&nbsp;R&D.
I joined as&nbsp;a Senior Software Engineer for&nbsp;the TAMA project - a&nbsp;scalable and&nbsp;high-performance distributed Anti-DDoS system.
After six months, I took on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Lead Developer for&nbsp;the project and&nbsp;contributed to&nbsp;shaping its further development.<br/><br/>

I specialized in&nbsp;implementing low-level system components (those at&nbsp;the network interface)
requiring efficient memory management and&nbsp;often creative problem-solving approaches.
It was necessary to&nbsp;maintain high performance and&nbsp;low-latency characteristics while implementing new,
secure code supporting new network protocols and&nbsp;features.
The work demanded close attention and&nbsp;frequent use of&nbsp;low-level tools
(assembler, profiler, fuzzer).<br/><br/>

During my work in&nbsp;TAMA project, I also developed the&nbsp;core of&nbsp;the system, a&nbsp;horizontally scalable cluster
processing data coming from edge units. I created complex user interfaces showing the&nbsp;network state in&nbsp;real-time and&nbsp;handled integrations with&nbsp;other internal systems.<br/><br/>

I led the&nbsp;release and&nbsp;deployment process for&nbsp;production environments,
which involved actively monitoring code quality
(code reviews, automated unit tests, integration tests, and&nbsp;end-to-end tests, CI/CD),
manual testing processes, and&nbsp;synchronization of&nbsp;work between teams.
I prepared new system versions and&nbsp;seamless deployment steps (partially automated).
My responsibility was also to&nbsp;recruit new team members.<br/><br/>

During my time at&nbsp;TAMA, my team successfully completed the&nbsp;full development of&nbsp;a new system that protects against application-layer (L7) attacks.
