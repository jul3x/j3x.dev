A team responsible for&nbsp;developing the&nbsp;University Study-Oriented System (USOS),
which is an&nbsp;IT system used by&nbsp;most universities in&nbsp;Poland and&nbsp;other European countries.
I worked on&nbsp;developing web applications that are part of&nbsp;the system: the&nbsp;Archive of&nbsp;Diploma Theses (APD) and&nbsp;the Internet Recruitment of&nbsp;Candidates (IRK). My responsibilities included backend development,
frontend development, and&nbsp;the release processes of&nbsp;new software versions.<br/><br/>

My time on&nbsp;the project coincided with&nbsp;the most intense period of&nbsp;the COVID-19 pandemic,
which led to&nbsp;a rapid digitization of&nbsp;processes to&nbsp;enable universities to&nbsp;operate remotely.
I participated in&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;remote diploma exam procedure in&nbsp;APD.
Most importantly, I developed a&nbsp;system module allowing students to&nbsp;browse thesis topics,
communicate with&nbsp;potential supervisors, and&nbsp;fill out multi-step electronic forms for&nbsp;remote topic approval.
I described the&nbsp;entire process in&nbsp;my master's thesis - <a href="/assets/files/mgr.pdf" class="bold" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
The procedures used during my diploma exam utilized the&nbsp;code
I wrote while working on&nbsp;my thesis.<br/><br/>

In IRK, I developed mechanisms for&nbsp;officially delivering electronic documents and&nbsp;created a&nbsp;separate system for&nbsp;international visitors to&nbsp;universities - the&nbsp;Internet Recruitment of&nbsp;Guests.
This system was a&nbsp;modification of&nbsp;the core IRK and&nbsp;allowed temporary visitors to&nbsp;access systems and&nbsp;services at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Warsaw.
