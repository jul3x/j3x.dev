A team responsible for developing the University Study-Oriented System (USOS),
which is an IT system used by most universities in Poland
and other European countries.
I worked on developing web applications that are part of the system: the Archive of Diploma Theses (APD)
and the Internet Recruitment of Candidates (IRK). My responsibilities included backend development,
frontend development, and the release processes of new software versions.<br/><br/>

My time on the project coincided with the most intense period of the COVID-19 pandemic,
which led to a rapid digitization of processes to enable universities to operate remotely.
I participated in creating a remote diploma exam procedure in APD.
Most importantly, I developed a system module allowing students to browse thesis topics,
communicate with potential supervisors, and fill out multi-step electronic forms
for remote topic approval.
I described the entire process in my master's thesis - <a href="/assets/files/mgr.pdf" class="bold" target="_blank">here</a>.
The procedures used during my diploma exam utilized the code
I wrote while working on my thesis.<br/><br/>

In IRK, I developed mechanisms for officially delivering electronic documents and created
a separate system for international visitors to universities - the Internet Recruitment of Guests.
This system was a modification of the core IRK and allowed temporary visitors to access systems
and services at the University of Warsaw.
