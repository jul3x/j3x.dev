An industrial automation company.
I was focused on&nbsp;selecting controllers and&nbsp;electrical equipment for&nbsp;tanks and&nbsp;mixers.
Most of&nbsp;my work involved designing electrical schematics and&nbsp;wiring layouts.
Additionally, I developed PLC programs for&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the designed controllers.
