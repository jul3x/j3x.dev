A Polish startup (now an&nbsp;established company) introducing fully autonomous
industrial mobile robots to&nbsp;the market. In an&nbsp;agile, interdisciplinary team (at the&nbsp;time, the&nbsp;company had
fewer than 10 developers), I primarily focused on&nbsp;designing navigation algorithms.
I co-authored a&nbsp;path-shifting algorithm – an&nbsp;efficient solution enabling stable and&nbsp;predictable autonomous driving of&nbsp;large units (up to&nbsp;1.5 tons) in&nbsp;chaotic industrial environments. I developed a&nbsp;precision docking algorithm for&nbsp;intermediary stations for&nbsp;robots with&nbsp;high inertia.
I also worked on&nbsp;improving the&nbsp;robots' motion control systems.<br/><br/>

Beyond navigation algorithms, my responsibilities extended to&nbsp;communication systems.
I designed the&nbsp;VBarWeb platform on&nbsp;the robots' onboard computers, enabling
remote configuration of&nbsp;low-level electronic modules through a&nbsp;flexible web interface.
This was achieved using a&nbsp;communication protocol implemented on&nbsp;the CAN bus and&nbsp;a wireless WiFi interface.
The project is described in&nbsp;more detail in&nbsp;the <strong>Realizations</strong> section and&nbsp;in <a href="/assets/files/inz.pdf" class="bold" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">my engineering thesis</a>.
<br/><br/>

Together with&nbsp;the team, I also helped design a&nbsp;multi-robot system (MRS) – a&nbsp;fleet of&nbsp;fully autonomous units
that communicated and&nbsp;collaborated to&nbsp;optimize task execution.
