A Polish startup (now an established company) introducing fully autonomous
industrial mobile robots to the market. In an agile, interdisciplinary team (at the time, the company had
fewer than 10 developers), I primarily focused on designing navigation algorithms.
I co-authored a path-shifting algorithm – an efficient solution enabling stable and predictable autonomous driving of large units (up to 1.5 tons)
in chaotic industrial environments. I developed a precision docking algorithm
for intermediary stations for robots with high inertia.
I also worked on improving the robots' motion control systems.<br/><br/>

Beyond navigation algorithms, my responsibilities extended to communication systems.
I designed the VBarWeb platform on the robots' onboard computers, enabling
remote configuration of low-level electronic modules through a flexible web interface.
This was achieved using a communication protocol implemented on the CAN bus and a wireless WiFi interface.
The project is described in more detail in the <strong>Realizations</strong> section and in <a href="/assets/files/inz.pdf" class="bold" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">my engineering thesis</a>.
<br/><br/>

Together with the team, I also helped design a multi-robot system (MRS) – a fleet of fully autonomous units
that communicated and collaborated to optimize task execution.
