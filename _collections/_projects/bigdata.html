Second big task for Big Data course at MIMUW.

Implementation of minimal parallel algorithm for checking how many points in the given dataset are greater (by all coordinates) than given one. The assumption is that there is approximately the same number of query points and data points.

Implementation consists of two versions - for 2D and 3D points datasets implemented in Spark 2.4.5 and prepared for being launched on top of YARN and HDFS.

Datasets are generated using generate_data.sh and generate_data_3d.sh scripts.

Theoretical background of the algorithm can be found in a paper https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3070607.3075961

Notice: Due to collisions, many of ports of HDFS setup had to be changed, so scripts may not work on any other cluster.
