    Hacking a Big Mouth Billy Bass â€” a nostalgic toy that some of us could get as a gift from uncle from the US - into an advanced, frequency-aware animatronic device was both a technical challenge and a delight. In this project, I transformed this singing fish into an interactive Bluetooth speaker that analyzes audio input and moves its head, tail, and mouth according to specific frequency bands. The result? A speaker that doesn't just play audio but reacts to it with precision, offering synchronized movements that make it seem alive.

    But why? The inspiration for this project came from my nephew, who was fascinated by fishes and asked me if we could make a toy come to life in a more dynamic way. While there are numerous DIY projects that repurpose Big Mouth Billy Bass, many miss the desired result of toy feeling the rhytm. Most existing examples either offer basic mouth movement or simple audio playback without nuanced synchronization - only depending on current audio volume. Unfortunately, this is not the case for creating anything resembling dancing and singing. That is why I created this project from scratch and used audio spectrum analysis (<strong>FFT</strong>) to achieve better results.
