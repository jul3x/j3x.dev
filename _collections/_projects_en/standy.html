   Mobile robot balancing on&nbsp;two wheels

<p>
In the&nbsp;era of&nbsp;ubiquitous <strong>hoverboards</strong>, a&nbsp;robot whose sole task is to&nbsp;maintain balance on&nbsp;a single axis of&nbsp;wheels might not seem impressive (actually, it was unlikely to&nbsp;spot any hoverboard in&nbsp;Poland in&nbsp;2018). However, it presents a&nbsp;very interesting theoretical and&nbsp;engineering challenge that can be quite troublesome.
</p>

<p>
Implementing such a&nbsp;project requires complex theoretical calculations using differential equations of&nbsp;motion. These equations must then be converted into state variable equations and&nbsp;solved using control theory for&nbsp;a given equilibrium point. The solution allows us to&nbsp;simulate the&nbsp;robot's behavior under various control methods.
</p>

<p>
The simulation enables optimal selection of&nbsp;the relationship between the&nbsp;robot's tilt and&nbsp;the force applied by&nbsp;the motors. This relationship must then be implemented in&nbsp;the robot's controller. Selecting the&nbsp;appropriate electronic components is crucial: microcontroller, accelerometers, motor drivers, battery, and&nbsp;the motors themselves. All elements must work together and&nbsp;be controlled by&nbsp;software uploaded to&nbsp;the microcontroller (handling sensor readings, calculating required power, transforming values into signals for&nbsp;the motors).
</p>

<p>
Since the&nbsp;robot is a&nbsp;physical entity, designing its structure and&nbsp;selecting the&nbsp;appropriate mechanical components is also necessary, followed by&nbsp;assembling everything into a&nbsp;whole. Ultimately, this often leads to&nbsp;the realization that the&nbsp;results from theoretical calculations do not align with&nbsp;reality (mainly due to&nbsp;accumulated simplification errors), necessitating experimental "tuning" of&nbsp;the control algorithm.

The project was a&nbsp;fascinating adventure and&nbsp;allowed for&nbsp;a more practical entry into the&nbsp;field of&nbsp;robotics. I described the&nbsp;theoretical foundations of&nbsp;the project <strong><a href="https://j3x.dev/assets/files/standy.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.
