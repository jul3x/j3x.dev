<p>
The Turing machine is an&nbsp;abstract model capable of&nbsp;executing algorithms, and&nbsp;despite its simplicity, it can realize any program that a&nbsp;modern computer can run. Introduced in&nbsp;1936, it has since become a&nbsp;crucial subject in&nbsp;logical theories and&nbsp;complexity proofs in&nbsp;computer science.
</p>
<p>
    The structure of&nbsp;a standard <strong>Turing Machine</strong> consists of&nbsp;an infinite tape divided into cells and&nbsp;a head that moves along the&nbsp;tape. Each cell can hold a&nbsp;certain value from a&nbsp;selected set of&nbsp;symbols, and&nbsp;the head can occupy a&nbsp;position on&nbsp;a cell and&nbsp;be in&nbsp;a specific state from a&nbsp;chosen set of&nbsp;states. The execution of&nbsp;any algorithm on&nbsp;a Turing Machine involves reading the&nbsp;value of&nbsp;the cell by&nbsp;the head, writing a&nbsp;new value, changing the&nbsp;state from the&nbsp;current one to&nbsp;the next, and&nbsp;moving left/right or&nbsp;halting the&nbsp;computation. Decisions regarding new values, states, and&nbsp;movements are made based on&nbsp;the rules outlined in&nbsp;the algorithm.
</p>

<p>A Turing Machine where there is only one possible behavior for&nbsp;a given cell value and&nbsp;state is called deterministic. If there are multiple possibilities, such a&nbsp;machine is a&nbsp;non-deterministic Turing machine and&nbsp;takes on&nbsp;more of&nbsp;the character of&nbsp;a thought process rather than an&nbsp;actual machine that can be built.

    In this project, I presented a&nbsp;<strong>non-deterministic Turing Machine interpreter</strong> written in&nbsp;Python. Specifically, my solution allows for&nbsp;checking whether the&nbsp;input machine will return a&nbsp;positive result for&nbsp;a given tape within a&nbsp;limited time (a restricted number of&nbsp;iterations). I wrote a&nbsp;few tests to&nbsp;check correctness, such as&nbsp;a Turing Machine that verifies if a&nbsp;word on&nbsp;the tape is a&nbsp;palindrome and&nbsp;another that checks if the&nbsp;first number on&nbsp;the tape is the&nbsp;square of&nbsp;the second. I also added a&nbsp;script that translates multi-tape Turing Machines into a&nbsp;single tape.

<p>Abstract, yet interesting.</p>
