    A passion project that kept me engaged for&nbsp;3 years.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>RAG3</strong> is a&nbsp;2D top-down shooter built on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;my own custom, cross-platform engine.
    The gameplay revolves around skillfully progressing through levels while eliminating all encountered obstacles.
    The game is characterized by&nbsp;its dynamic pace, often requiring a&nbsp;high level of&nbsp;concentration.
</p>

<p>
    One of&nbsp;the most distinguishing mechanics is <strong>active time manipulation</strong>.
    Players can slow down the&nbsp;gameplay for&nbsp;short periods (bullet time) or&nbsp;even travel back in&nbsp;time.
    This feature is tightly integrated with&nbsp;the gameplay and&nbsp;can be used dynamically.
    The time manipulation mechanics is also deeply connected to&nbsp;the storyline, which can only be uncovered through gameplay.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of&nbsp;the game is to&nbsp;deliver excitement and&nbsp;joy through combat with&nbsp;various creatures while exploring a&nbsp;wide range of&nbsp;locations (from labyrinths to&nbsp;open worlds). <strong>Warning!</strong> Time travel can be very dangerous and&nbsp;may have disastrous consequences. Be careful when encountering your past self!
</p>

<p>
    In addition to&nbsp;the single-player campaign, the&nbsp;demo version also includes a&nbsp;<strong>multiplayer</strong> mode. The current package supports multiplayer in&nbsp;a classic deathmatch format, staying true to&nbsp;the retro game style.
</p>

<p>
    The game features an&nbsp;original soundtrack composed by&nbsp;me and&nbsp;custom graphics. Alongside the&nbsp;game's development, I worked on&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;cross-platform engine using C++, SFML, GLSL, and&nbsp;TGUI. Over the&nbsp;course of&nbsp;3 years, I developed a&nbsp;comprehensive solution for&nbsp;creating various types of&nbsp;games. The systems included in&nbsp;the <strong>RAG3</strong> engine are:<br/>
    - Shader-based graphics engine<br/>
    - <strong>Physics</strong> engine<br/>
    - Sound/music engine<br/>
    - Configuration file system using a&nbsp;simple interpreted language <strong>(*.j3x)</strong><br/>
    - Network communication via custom protocol based on&nbsp;UDP and&nbsp;TCP<br/>
    - Event engine (for time manipulation)<br/>
    - <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> engine, featuring efficient pathfinding and&nbsp;decision-making<br/>
    - Complex user interface<br/>
    - RPG system (weapon upgrades, experience points, character improvements)<br/>
    - NPC dialogue system<br/>
    - Particle systems (animations, explosions)<br/>
    - Achievement and&nbsp;stats system<br/>
    - Save/load system<br/>
    - <strong>Full editor</strong> for&nbsp;editing maps, scripted behaviors, game parameters, and&nbsp;objects
