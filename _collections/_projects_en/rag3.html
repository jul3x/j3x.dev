    A passion project that kept me engaged for 3 years.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>RAG3</strong> is a 2D top-down shooter built on top of my own custom, cross-platform engine.
    The gameplay revolves around skillfully progressing through levels while eliminating all encountered obstacles.
    The game is characterized by its dynamic pace, often requiring a high level of concentration.
</p>

<p>
    One of the most distinguishing mechanics is <strong>active time manipulation</strong>.
    Players can slow down the gameplay for short periods (bullet time) or even travel back in time.
    This feature is tightly integrated with the gameplay and can be used dynamically.
    The time manipulation mechanics is also deeply connected to the storyline, which can only be uncovered through gameplay.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of the game is to deliver excitement and joy through combat with various creatures while exploring a wide range of locations (from labyrinths to open worlds). <strong>Warning!</strong> Time travel can be very dangerous and may have disastrous consequences. Be careful when encountering your past self!
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the single-player campaign, the demo version also includes a <strong>multiplayer</strong> mode. The current package supports multiplayer in a classic deathmatch format, staying true to the retro game style.
</p>

<p>
    The game features an original soundtrack composed by me and custom graphics. Alongside the game's development, I worked on creating a cross-platform engine using C++, SFML, GLSL, and TGUI. Over the course of 3 years, I developed a comprehensive solution for creating various types of games. The systems included in the <strong>RAG3</strong> engine are:<br/>
    - Shader-based graphics engine<br/>
    - <strong>Physics</strong> engine<br/>
    - Sound/music engine<br/>
    - Configuration file system using a simple interpreted language <strong>(*.j3x)</strong><br/>
    - Network communication via custom protocol based on UDP and TCP<br/>
    - Event engine (for time manipulation)<br/>
    - <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> engine, featuring efficient pathfinding and decision-making<br/>
    - Complex user interface<br/>
    - RPG system (weapon upgrades, experience points, character improvements)<br/>
    - NPC dialogue system<br/>
    - Particle systems (animations, explosions)<br/>
    - Achievement and stats system<br/>
    - Save/load system<br/>
    - <strong>Full editor</strong> for editing maps, scripted behaviors, game parameters, and objects
