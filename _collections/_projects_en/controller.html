   Game controller with&nbsp;a gyroscope based on&nbsp;STM32
project_url: https://github.com/jul3x/GameControllerSTM32
---

A PC game controller based on&nbsp;an STM32 microcontroller with&nbsp;an ARM Cortex-M core (the code was implemented on&nbsp;the STM32F411xE module). It uses standard buttons (shoot / jump) and&nbsp;an inertial measurement unit (IMU - accelerometer + gyroscope) for&nbsp;player control. The main feature of&nbsp;the controller is enabling dynamic gameplay through air movements.<br/><br/>

The device communicates with&nbsp;the computer via USART USB, transmitting real-time sensor readings connected to&nbsp;the microcontroller. The microcontroller code implementation utilizes interrupt-driven operations to&nbsp;optimize resource use. Internal communication between the&nbsp;microcontroller and&nbsp;sensors takes place using the&nbsp;I2C protocol.<br/><br/>

I also wrote code for&nbsp;a simple driver that supports the&nbsp;controller connected to&nbsp;a PC, allowing you to&nbsp;play the&nbsp;classic game Wolfenstein 3D. You can see it <strong><a href="https://github.com/jul3x/GameControllerDriver">here</a></strong>.
