<p>
    <strong>Spirit Runner</strong> is a dynamic action platformer focused on skillfully navigating levels while escaping danger and collecting as many points as possible. The game takes place in a two-dimensional side-scrolling format. Players can choose between two game modes: standard mode, which involves progressing through levels with increasing difficulty, and endless mode, set on a procedurally generated map. The game was developed in collaboration with <strong><a href="https://github.com/danielm1405" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@danielm1405</a></strong>.

    Player control is limited; the only action available is choosing when to jump. Players have no influence over the game's speed. The character runs continuously throughout the game, and the player's task is to ensure they do not fall into pits, jump from building to building, grab onto steel pipes, and avoid fires (and other obstacles). This simple mechanic has many implications, as the maps are designed to offer players a choice of multiple paths. However, not every path is the right oneâ€”some may be more challenging than others.

    The game also features a replay mechanism. After successfully completing a level, players can relive their experience through a recorded replay from a special "camera."

    This is one of the few projects I've written in Java. In hindsight, I know it will definitely be the last one in that language ;).
