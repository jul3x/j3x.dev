<p>
    <strong>Spirit Runner</strong> is a&nbsp;dynamic action platformer focused on&nbsp;skillfully navigating levels while escaping danger and&nbsp;collecting as&nbsp;many points as&nbsp;possible. The game takes place in&nbsp;a two-dimensional side-scrolling format. Players can choose between two game modes: standard mode, which involves progressing through levels with&nbsp;increasing difficulty, and&nbsp;endless mode, set on&nbsp;a procedurally generated map. The game was developed in&nbsp;collaboration with&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/danielm1405" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@danielm1405</a></strong>.

    Player control is limited; the&nbsp;only action available is choosing when to&nbsp;jump. Players have no influence over the&nbsp;game's speed. The character runs continuously throughout the&nbsp;game, and&nbsp;the player's task is to&nbsp;ensure they do not fall into pits, jump from building to&nbsp;building, grab onto steel pipes, and&nbsp;avoid fires (and other obstacles). This simple mechanic has many implications, as&nbsp;the maps are designed to&nbsp;offer players a&nbsp;choice of&nbsp;multiple paths. However, not every path is the&nbsp;right oneâ€”some may be more challenging than others.

    The game also features a&nbsp;replay mechanism. After successfully completing a&nbsp;level, players can relive their experience through a&nbsp;recorded replay from a&nbsp;special "camera."

    This is one of&nbsp;the few projects I've written in&nbsp;Java. In hindsight, I know it will definitely be the&nbsp;last one in&nbsp;that language ;).
