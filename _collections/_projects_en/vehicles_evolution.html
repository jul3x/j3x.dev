<p>
    Many algorithms designed for&nbsp;problem-solving by&nbsp;computers draw inspiration from nature. One such group is evolutionary algorithms, which find optimal solutions through evolution and&nbsp;iteratively refining proposals until the&nbsp;one best suited to&nbsp;the given conditions is found. During my studies, together with&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/danielm1405" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@danielm1405</a></strong>, we implemented a&nbsp;specific case of&nbsp;an evolutionary algorithm—a genetic algorithm. We demonstrated its application for... finding the&nbsp;optimal design of&nbsp;an off-road vehicle.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>genetic algorithm</strong> is a&nbsp;variation of&nbsp;an evolutionary algorithm that, in&nbsp;simplified terms, involves:
    - Creating a&nbsp;population (in our case, vehicles) of&nbsp;random units.
    - Evaluating which of&nbsp;them performed best at&nbsp;the task. In our case, it was to&nbsp;travel the&nbsp;greatest distance on&nbsp;a given 2D map composed of&nbsp;hills, holes, and&nbsp;steep inclines.
    - Selecting a&nbsp;certain percentage of&nbsp;the winning units. We chose the&nbsp;top 5-10% of&nbsp;designs.
    - Creating the&nbsp;next population based on&nbsp;two mechanisms—crossover and&nbsp;mutation. The first process involved creating a&nbsp;new unit based on&nbsp;two randomly selected "parents." The "child" had averaged (but partially biased towards one or&nbsp;the other parent) parameters of&nbsp;the parents. Mutations involved introducing completely new values (mutations) for&nbsp;random parameters in&nbsp;a small part of&nbsp;the new population. Both processes were equally important to&nbsp;find the&nbsp;optimal solution to&nbsp;the problem.
    - Repeating the&nbsp;process hundreds to&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;times until the&nbsp;resulting solution seemed optimal.
</p>

<p>
    Due to&nbsp;the random nature of&nbsp;evolutionary algorithms, the&nbsp;solutions proposed can often be surprising. Different runs of&nbsp;the program can yield completely different results. However, at&nbsp;some point in&nbsp;each run, after several hundred generations (iterations of&nbsp;the population), a&nbsp;stabilization trend becomes noticeable. The process of&nbsp;reaching the&nbsp;final solution is also quite fascinating.
</p>

<p>
    Our implementation allows users to&nbsp;create their own maps and&nbsp;control the&nbsp;parameters of&nbsp;the genetic algorithm. A visualization of&nbsp;the progress of&nbsp;each population and&nbsp;how each unit individually performs the&nbsp;task is also displayed.
