<p>
A simple, configurable 3D music visualizer written in&nbsp;pure <strong>C++</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>OpenGL</strong>, using a&nbsp;sound analysis library.
</p>

<p>
The animation displays a&nbsp;special grid of&nbsp;points (rendered in&nbsp;a user-defined way) in&nbsp;3D space based on&nbsp;the current sound spectrum. For sound analysis, the&nbsp;program primarily uses the&nbsp;<strong>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong> and&nbsp;energy analysis in&nbsp;one-second windows. It then presents a&nbsp;logarithmic graph of&nbsp;the intensity of&nbsp;each frequency range using the&nbsp;height of&nbsp;the points on&nbsp;the grid. On the&nbsp;second axis, the&nbsp;height of&nbsp;the points is extrapolated using a&nbsp;normal distribution to&nbsp;smooth it out and&nbsp;create a&nbsp;"hill" effect.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, camera movement depends on&nbsp;the current sound energy. The higher the&nbsp;value, the&nbsp;faster the&nbsp;rotation. The higher the&nbsp;bass frequencies, the&nbsp;closer the&nbsp;zoom to&nbsp;the grid of&nbsp;points.
</p>

<p>
All these features come together to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;pretty neat effect, which works best with&nbsp;energetic tracks. The <strong>visualizer</strong> with&nbsp;minor post-processing can be seen in&nbsp;the attached video.
