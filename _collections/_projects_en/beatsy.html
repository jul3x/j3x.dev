<p>
A simple, configurable 3D music visualizer written in pure <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>OpenGL</strong>, using a sound analysis library.
</p>

<p>
The animation displays a special grid of points (rendered in a user-defined way) in 3D space based on the current sound spectrum. For sound analysis, the program primarily uses the <strong>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong> and energy analysis in one-second windows. It then presents a logarithmic graph of the intensity of each frequency range using the height of the points on the grid. On the second axis, the height of the points is extrapolated using a normal distribution to smooth it out and create a "hill" effect.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, camera movement depends on the current sound energy. The higher the value, the faster the rotation. The higher the bass frequencies, the closer the zoom to the grid of points.
</p>

<p>
All these features come together to create a pretty neat effect, which works best with energetic tracks. The <strong>visualizer</strong> with minor post-processing can be seen in the attached video.
