   Interactive simulator of&nbsp;interplanetary gravitational forces
project_url: https://github.com/jul3x/Gravity

<p>
<strong>Gravity</strong> is an&nbsp;interactive simulator of&nbsp;interplanetary gravitational forces. It allows for&nbsp;the simple creation of&nbsp;space motion scenarios, the&nbsp;active addition of&nbsp;new objects, and&nbsp;saving examples for&nbsp;later. It consists of&nbsp;a simple graphical interface and&nbsp;mouse + keyboard controls. A configuration file is also available to&nbsp;the user, allowing changes to&nbsp;the appearance and&nbsp;basic physical constants considered in&nbsp;the calculations.
</p>

<p>
The operation is based on&nbsp;solving systems of&nbsp;motion equations (differential equations) in&nbsp;real-time using the&nbsp;<strong>4th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm</strong>. Given the&nbsp;masses and&nbsp;positions of&nbsp;the objects relative to&nbsp;each other, the&nbsp;algorithm in&nbsp;the simulator can calculate, with&nbsp;sufficiently good approximation, the&nbsp;system of&nbsp;forces acting on&nbsp;each object individually. Using <strong>Newton's laws of&nbsp;motion</strong>, such systems can be transformed into systems of&nbsp;motion equations, which can then be solved numerically for&nbsp;given initial conditions.
</p>

<p>
An additional feature is the&nbsp;handling of&nbsp;object collisions. <strong>Gravity</strong> handles such events using the&nbsp;"bigger wins" method and&nbsp;applies the&nbsp;<strong>law of&nbsp;conservation of&nbsp;momentum</strong> to&nbsp;calculate the&nbsp;further trajectory of&nbsp;the remaining object.
</p>

<p>
The project was implemented in&nbsp;C++, SFML, and&nbsp;TGUI as&nbsp;an introduction to&nbsp;creating my own framework/engine for&nbsp;developing 2D games. I started working on&nbsp;the graphical and&nbsp;physics modules, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a simple configuration file handler in&nbsp;a custom format <strong>(*.j3x)</strong>.
