<p>
The satisfiability problem (<strong>SAT</strong>) is one of&nbsp;the most important problems in&nbsp;mathematical logic. It involves determining whether there exists any assignment of&nbsp;truth values (either "true" or&nbsp;"false") to&nbsp;a given logical formula (a representation of&nbsp;logical variables and&nbsp;operations among them) such that the&nbsp;formula evaluates to&nbsp;true.
</p>

<p>
    While the&nbsp;formulation of&nbsp;this problem may sound entirely theoretical and&nbsp;abstract, it carries a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;more tangible consequences. This problem belongs to&nbsp;the class of&nbsp;NP problems, meaning (in a&nbsp;simplified sense) that finding a&nbsp;solution for&nbsp;a given logical formula is computationally intensive, whereas verifying whether a&nbsp;solution is correct can be done in&nbsp;a shorter (polynomial) time. Problems in&nbsp;this class are often characterized by&nbsp;a <strong>brute-force</strong> approach, which entails exploring the&nbsp;entire space of&nbsp;possible solutions and&nbsp;checking which one is correct.

<p>
    The <strong>SAT</strong> problem is also NP-hard (being in&nbsp;the NP class makes it NP-complete). This means that all problems that belong to&nbsp;the NP class can be transformed (in polynomial time) into the&nbsp;SAT problem. This makes it a&nbsp;completely universal problem, as&nbsp;finding an&nbsp;optimal solution for&nbsp;SAT implies finding optimal solutions for&nbsp;every problem in&nbsp;the NP class. This issue is one of&nbsp;the current Millennium Prize Problems (more <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></strong>).

    The computational complexity of&nbsp;the SAT problem greatly limits the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;optimally find solutions. However, there are various optimization techniques that allow for&nbsp;the resolution of&nbsp;a considerable number of&nbsp;logical formulas in&nbsp;a reasonable time. In a&nbsp;project completed during my master's studies, I presented a&nbsp;solution to&nbsp;the <strong>SAT</strong> problem using the&nbsp;<strong>DPLL</strong> algorithm, depth-first search, and&nbsp;the divide-and-conquer principle. The implementation was written in&nbsp;<strong>Haskell</strong>.
