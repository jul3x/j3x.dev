<p>
An implementation of&nbsp;the popular cellular automaton <strong>"Conway's Game of&nbsp;Life"</strong> written in&nbsp;<strong>x86_64 Assembly</strong> (NASM syntax).
</p>

<p>
How does it work? A grid of&nbsp;live or&nbsp;dead cells with&nbsp;dimensions n x m. The game proceeds iteratively. In each new iteration, every cell changes its state or&nbsp;remains the&nbsp;same.<br/><br/>
- If a&nbsp;cell is dead and&nbsp;has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to&nbsp;life.<br/>
- If a&nbsp;cell is alive and&nbsp;has two or&nbsp;three live neighbors, it stays alive.<br/>
- Otherwise, it dies.<br/>
</p>

<p>
These three simple rules allow for&nbsp;the construction of&nbsp;very advanced and&nbsp;interesting patterns, which have been the&nbsp;subject of&nbsp;many studies worldwide over the&nbsp;years. <strong>"The Game of&nbsp;Life"</strong> is Turing complete (in simple terms: it can solve the&nbsp;same set of&nbsp;problems as&nbsp;a computer). For example, this allows for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfuhbI8HE7s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>building a&nbsp;computer with&nbsp;a monitor</strong></a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>playing the&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Life within the&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Life</strong></a>.
