<p>
An implementation of the popular cellular automaton <strong>"Conway's Game of Life"</strong> written in <strong>x86_64 Assembly</strong> (NASM syntax).
</p>

<p>
How does it work? A grid of live or dead cells with dimensions n x m. The game proceeds iteratively. In each new iteration, every cell changes its state or remains the same.<br/><br/>
- If a cell is dead and has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to life.<br/>
- If a cell is alive and has two or three live neighbors, it stays alive.<br/>
- Otherwise, it dies.<br/>
</p>

<p>
These three simple rules allow for the construction of very advanced and interesting patterns, which have been the subject of many studies worldwide over the years. <strong>"The Game of Life"</strong> is Turing complete (in simple terms: it can solve the same set of problems as a computer). For example, this allows for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfuhbI8HE7s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>building a computer with a monitor</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>playing the Game of Life within the Game of Life</strong></a>.
