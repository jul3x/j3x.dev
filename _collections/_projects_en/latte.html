   Compiler for the object-oriented Latte language to x86 ASM
project_url: https://github.com/jul3x/LatteCompiler
---

A simple compiler for the Latte programming language (a statically typed language with object-oriented features) to x86 GAS assembly. The language is syntactically and semantically similar to Java. A description of its context-free grammar can be found in the GitHub repository.<br/><br/>

Along with the language syntax, the compiler is a fully functional development tool that allows the writing of complex programs. The repository contains dozens of test programs and automatic functional tests (including output comparison).<br/><br/>

The compiler supports:<br/>
* syntactic analysis<br/>
* semantic analysis<br/>
* type checking<br/>
* garbage collection<br/>
* control flow and infinite loop detection<br/>
* constant folding for simple arithmetic expressions<br/>
* constant folding for simple logical expressions<br/>
* removal of redundant code (push/pop and pop/push sequences)<br/>
* removal of unreachable code<br/>

The project was developed during my master's studies.<br/><br/>

As an introduction to the world of compilers, I also implemented a simple compiler for arithmetic expressions to JVM bytecode and LLVM bitcode. You can see the code <strong><a href="https://github.com/jul3x/InstantCompiler">here</a></strong>.
