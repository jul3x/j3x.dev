<p>
    Between 2013 and 2015, I completed a series of projects in collaboration with Scorise.
</p>

<p>
    I was involved in tasks such as <strong>cutting</strong> complex designs (i.e., converting graphic designs into websites), <strong>configuring WordPress sites</strong>, <strong>adapting graphic themes</strong>, and <strong>optimizing website security</strong>.
</p>

    The attached image shows an example of a website I sliced for the company KMZOZ.pl.
