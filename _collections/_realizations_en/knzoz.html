<p>
    Between 2013 and&nbsp;2015, I completed a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;projects in&nbsp;collaboration with&nbsp;Scorise.
</p>

<p>
    I was involved in&nbsp;tasks such as&nbsp;<strong>cutting</strong> complex designs (i.e., converting graphic designs into websites), <strong>configuring WordPress sites</strong>, <strong>adapting graphic themes</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>optimizing website security</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The attached image shows an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;a website I sliced for&nbsp;the company KMZOZ.pl.
