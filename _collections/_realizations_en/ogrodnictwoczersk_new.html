<p>
An updated version of&nbsp;the website for&nbsp;<strong>Ogrodnictwo i Szkółka Roślin Łangowscy</strong>. Due to&nbsp;the success of&nbsp;the previous online version, the&nbsp;owners decided to&nbsp;invest in&nbsp;a more modern website. The impact of&nbsp;the online brand was significant, and&nbsp;the site became the&nbsp;primary promotional tool for&nbsp;the company.
</p>

<p>
    The website (like its predecessor) was built with&nbsp;ease of&nbsp;configuration in&nbsp;mind. The owners have substantial freedom in&nbsp;managing the&nbsp;content. The interface allows for&nbsp;adding news, editing the&nbsp;offerings, updating business hours, and&nbsp;managing all other information.
</p>

<p>
    The design of&nbsp;the site meets more modern standards and&nbsp;moves away from outdated "container" styles. Sections are adapted to&nbsp;wide screens and&nbsp;fill a&nbsp;larger portion of&nbsp;the window. The site is interactive, featuring animations and&nbsp;moving elements, making it more visually engaging. This version was also implemented in&nbsp;a responsive web design (RWD) style, ensuring compatibility with&nbsp;mobile devices and&nbsp;other non-standard resolutions.
    </p>

<p>
    Responsibilities: graphic design, implementation in&nbsp;WordPress, security, hosting, SEO, online branding
