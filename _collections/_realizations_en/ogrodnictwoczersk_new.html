<p>
An updated version of the website for <strong>Ogrodnictwo i Szkółka Roślin Łangowscy</strong>. Due to the success of the previous online version, the owners decided to invest in a more modern website. The impact of the online brand was significant, and the site became the primary promotional tool for the company.
</p>

<p>
    The website (like its predecessor) was built with ease of configuration in mind. The owners have substantial freedom in managing the content. The interface allows for adding news, editing the offerings, updating business hours, and managing all other information.
</p>

<p>
    The design of the site meets more modern standards and moves away from outdated "container" styles. Sections are adapted to wide screens and fill a larger portion of the window. The site is interactive, featuring animations and moving elements, making it more visually engaging. This version was also implemented in a responsive web design (RWD) style, ensuring compatibility with mobile devices and other non-standard resolutions.

<p>
    Responsibilities: graphic design, implementation in WordPress, security, hosting, SEO, online branding
