<p>
The initial version of the website for <strong>Ogrodnictwo i Szkółka Roślin Łangowscy</strong>. The site became a key promotional tool for the nursery, attracting new customers and facilitating the management of their offerings. Thanks to an intuitive interface, the owners could independently update the content.
</p>

<p>
    The website was built with ease of configuration in mind. The site owners had significant flexibility in managing the content. The interface allowed for adding news, editing the offerings, updating business hours, and managing all other information.
</p>

<p>
   In addition to executing the project and implementing the site using <strong>WordPress</strong>, I successfully established the company's online presence. Together with the owners, we developed the company’s online image and optimized the site for search engines. As a result, the company achieved a top position in local search results related to gardening.

    After a few years, the website received a refreshed look, and the version shown in the screenshot was retired.
