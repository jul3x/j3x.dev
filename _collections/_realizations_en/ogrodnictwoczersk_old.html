<p>
The initial version of&nbsp;the website for&nbsp;<strong>Ogrodnictwo i Szkółka Roślin Łangowscy</strong>. The site became a&nbsp;key promotional tool for&nbsp;the nursery, attracting new customers and&nbsp;facilitating the&nbsp;management of&nbsp;their offerings. Thanks to&nbsp;an intuitive interface, the&nbsp;owners could independently update the&nbsp;content.
</p>

<p>
    The website was built with&nbsp;ease of&nbsp;configuration in&nbsp;mind. The site owners had significant flexibility in&nbsp;managing the&nbsp;content. The interface allowed for&nbsp;adding news, editing the&nbsp;offerings, updating business hours, and&nbsp;managing all other information.
</p>

<p>
   In addition to&nbsp;executing the&nbsp;project and&nbsp;implementing the&nbsp;site using <strong>WordPress</strong>, I successfully established the&nbsp;company's online presence. Together with&nbsp;the owners, we developed the&nbsp;company’s online image and&nbsp;optimized the&nbsp;site for&nbsp;search engines. As a&nbsp;result, the&nbsp;company achieved a&nbsp;top position in&nbsp;local search results related to&nbsp;gardening.

<p>
    After a&nbsp;few years, the&nbsp;website received a&nbsp;refreshed look, and&nbsp;the version shown in&nbsp;the screenshot was retired.
