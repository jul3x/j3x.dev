<p>
The Archive of Diploma Theses (<strong>APD</strong>) is one of many web services integrated
with the University Study-Oriented System (<strong>USOS</strong> – a comprehensive system used by most Polish universities and several in Europe). This application serves as a catalog and repository
for electronic versions of academic papers produced at the university.
</p>
<p>
The global situation in 2020 increased the importance of computer systems.
Many processes previously handled in traditional ways had to be rapidly transitioned into the digital world.
Specifically, student service processes could no longer continue in their existing form.
It was necessary to introduce alternative processes or adapt existing ones to the new circumstances.
</p>
<p>
While working in the <strong>Zespół Roboczy ds. USOS</strong>, I developed a tool that extends the basic functionality of the application by supporting processes for announcing, negotiating, and approving diploma thesis topics. I introduced a solution that allowed for the elimination of paper documents and standardized procedures across universities. The new interface also assisted all students facing the task of choosing a thesis topic by offering a comprehensive catalog of proposed topics.
</p>
<p>
The new module enabled the complete transition of the paperwork into digital, structured procedures. It significantly accelerated communication between students, supervisors, and examination committee members. Since then, it has been successfully used at many universities in Poland and Europe.

<p>
The project is described in my master's thesis, which you can read <a class="bold" href="/assets/files/mgr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (mostly in Polish). The module was deployed in production at the university before I defended my thesis. All the formalities related to my exam were handled using... the very module I developed.
