The Archive of&nbsp;Diploma Theses (<strong>APD</strong>) is one of&nbsp;many web services integrated with&nbsp;the University Study-Oriented System (<strong>USOS</strong> – a&nbsp;comprehensive system used by&nbsp;most Polish universities and&nbsp;several in&nbsp;Europe). This application serves as&nbsp;a catalog and&nbsp;repository for&nbsp;electronic versions of&nbsp;academic papers produced at&nbsp;the university.
</p>
<p>
The global situation in&nbsp;2020 increased the&nbsp;importance of&nbsp;computer systems.
Many processes previously handled in&nbsp;traditional ways had to&nbsp;be rapidly transitioned into the&nbsp;digital world.
Specifically, student service processes could no longer continue in&nbsp;their existing form.
It was necessary to&nbsp;introduce alternative processes or&nbsp;adapt existing ones to&nbsp;the new circumstances.
</p>
<p>
While working in&nbsp;the <strong>Zespół Roboczy ds. USOS</strong>, I developed a&nbsp;tool that extends the&nbsp;basic functionality of&nbsp;the application by&nbsp;supporting processes for&nbsp;announcing, negotiating, and&nbsp;approving diploma thesis topics. I introduced a&nbsp;solution that allowed for&nbsp;the elimination of&nbsp;paper documents and&nbsp;standardized procedures across universities. The new interface also assisted all students facing the&nbsp;task of&nbsp;choosing a&nbsp;thesis topic by&nbsp;offering a&nbsp;comprehensive catalog of&nbsp;proposed topics.
</p>
<p>
The new module enabled the&nbsp;complete transition of&nbsp;the paperwork into digital, structured procedures. It significantly accelerated communication between students, supervisors, and&nbsp;examination committee members. Since then, it has been successfully used at&nbsp;many universities in&nbsp;Poland and&nbsp;Europe.

    The project is described in&nbsp;my master's thesis, which you can read <a class="bold" href="/assets/files/mgr.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> (mostly in&nbsp;Polish). The module was deployed in&nbsp;production at&nbsp;the university before I defended my thesis. All the&nbsp;formalities related to&nbsp;my exam were handled using... the&nbsp;very module I developed.
