    TwojeWnętrza approached me to&nbsp;help create business value online. My task was to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;complete e-commerce store along with&nbsp;a company website.
    The store needed to&nbsp;allow users to&nbsp;browse the&nbsp;company's offerings, register and&nbsp;maintain their accounts, and&nbsp;make purchases (from product browsing to&nbsp;payment).
</p>

<p>
    At the&nbsp;time, this was quite a&nbsp;challenge but&nbsp;was successfully completed. I managed to&nbsp;design, implement in&nbsp;WooCommerce, and&nbsp;launch a&nbsp;fully operational portal. A significant portion of&nbsp;the work was dedicated to&nbsp;security and&nbsp;SEO optimization. The store received a&nbsp;modern design and&nbsp;a mobile-friendly version.
