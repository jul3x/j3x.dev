    TwojeWnętrza approached me to help create business value online. My task was to develop a complete e-commerce store along with a company website.
    The store needed to allow users to browse the company's offerings, register and maintain their accounts, and make purchases (from product browsing to payment).

    At the time, this was quite a challenge but was successfully completed. I managed to design, implement in WooCommerce, and launch a fully operational portal. A significant portion of the work was dedicated to security and SEO optimization. The store received a modern design and a mobile-friendly version.
