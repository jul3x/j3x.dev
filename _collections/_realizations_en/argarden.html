<p>
    One of my first <strong>commercial</strong> projects.
</p>

<p>
    A website for a local company that manufactures garden furniture.
    Despite its age, it is still available online.
</p>

<p>
    My responsibilities included: <strong>design, slicing, hosting, and populating the site with content</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The website was built using pure HTML and CSS.
