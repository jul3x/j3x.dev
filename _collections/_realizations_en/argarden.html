<p>
    One of&nbsp;my first <strong>commercial</strong> projects.
</p>

<p>
    A website for&nbsp;a local company that manufactures garden furniture.
    Despite its age, it is still available online.
</p>

<p>
    My responsibilities included: <strong>design, slicing, hosting, and&nbsp;populating the&nbsp;site with&nbsp;content</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The website was built using pure HTML and&nbsp;CSS.
