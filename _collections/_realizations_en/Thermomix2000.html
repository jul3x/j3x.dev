<p>
    A project of&nbsp;server and&nbsp;controller designed for&nbsp;<strong>SmartHome</strong> applications focused on&nbsp;managing heating installations. The system's goal is simple – to&nbsp;enable real-time monitoring of&nbsp;the installation, provide historical measurement data, and&nbsp;(in the&nbsp;near future) allow adjustments.
</p>

<p>
    This system was developed due to&nbsp;family needs. It required support for&nbsp;"Chinese" non-standard sensors and&nbsp;reverse engineering their registers. For this project, I wrote communication code for&nbsp;temperature sensors using <strong>CH341 MODBUS RTU</strong>. A user interface was created to&nbsp;provide continuous monitoring of&nbsp;the installation, which consists of&nbsp;several sensors. Everything is displayed on&nbsp;a clear installation diagram similar to&nbsp;<strong>SCADA</strong> systems.
</p>

<p>
    I strive to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;implementation as&nbsp;configurable as&nbsp;possible. The source code includes a&nbsp;configuration file describing the&nbsp;sensor map, installation diagram, and&nbsp;other additional parameters. The project is distributed under <strong>open-source</strong> principles – I want to&nbsp;allow others with&nbsp;similar needs to&nbsp;use my work for&nbsp;their own purposes.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, the&nbsp;system is still in&nbsp;the early stages of&nbsp;development, though it is already being used successfully.
