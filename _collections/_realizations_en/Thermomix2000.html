<p>
    A project of server and controller designed for <strong>SmartHome</strong> applications focused on managing heating installations. The system's goal is simple – to enable real-time monitoring of the installation, provide historical measurement data, and (in the near future) allow adjustments.
</p>

<p>
    This system was developed due to family needs. It required support for "Chinese" non-standard sensors and reverse engineering their registers. For this project, I wrote communication code for temperature sensors using <strong>CH341 MODBUS RTU</strong>. A user interface was created to provide continuous monitoring of the installation, which consists of several sensors. Everything is displayed on a clear installation diagram similar to <strong>SCADA</strong> systems.
</p>

<p>
    I strive to make the implementation as configurable as possible. The source code includes a configuration file describing the sensor map, installation diagram, and other additional parameters. The project is distributed under <strong>open-source</strong> principles – I want to allow others with similar needs to use my work for their own purposes.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, the system is still in the early stages of development, though it is already being used successfully.
