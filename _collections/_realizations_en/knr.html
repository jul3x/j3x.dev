    Design and development of a functional website for the Robotics Student Association (<strong>KNR</strong>) at the Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics (<strong>MEiL</strong>). The website aimed to promote the association's activities, facilitate new member recruitment, archive projects and events, and enhance user interaction.

<p>
    As a member from 2016-2017 and the creator of the site, I was able to leverage my skills to support the association's activities and promote a passion for robotics.

    The site was built using <strong>WordPress</strong> and was designed from scratch by me.
