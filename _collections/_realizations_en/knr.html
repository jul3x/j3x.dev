    Design and&nbsp;development of&nbsp;a functional website for&nbsp;the Robotics Student Association (<strong>KNR</strong>) at&nbsp;the Warsaw University of&nbsp;Technology, Faculty of&nbsp;Mechanical Engineering and&nbsp;Aeronautics (<strong>MEiL</strong>). The website aimed to&nbsp;promote the&nbsp;association's activities, facilitate new member recruitment, archive projects and&nbsp;events, and&nbsp;enhance user interaction.
</p>

<p>
    As a&nbsp;member from 2016-2017 and&nbsp;the creator of&nbsp;the site, I was able to&nbsp;leverage my skills to&nbsp;support the&nbsp;association's activities and&nbsp;promote a&nbsp;passion for&nbsp;robotics.
</p>

<p>
    The site was built using <strong>WordPress</strong> and&nbsp;was designed from scratch by&nbsp;me.
