  Algorithmic problem sets preparing for olympiads

<p>
While collaborating with the Talent Association, I designed preparatory problem sets for the <strong>Junior Olympiad in Informatics</strong> (OIG).
</p>

<p>
The problems consisted of creatively masked <strong>algorithmic problems</strong> using colorful stories.
The task solver had to analyze the story and formulate a mathematical problem. Using the example queries and answers provided in the problem,
the solver was then required to propose a <strong>computer program</strong> that, while meeting the specified conditions (such as maximum number values and <strong>memory-time constraints</strong>),
would solve the problem for a set of test cases. A particular challenge in the proposed problems was to find a solution with appropriately low <strong>computational complexity</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    I prepared four sets of problems along with sample solutions that address these problems. The problem statements (in Polish) and the code (written in <strong>C++</strong>) can be accessed through the links below:
