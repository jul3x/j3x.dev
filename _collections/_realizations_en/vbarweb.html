<p>
    At <strong>VersaBox</strong>, one of&nbsp;my tasks was to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;cross-platform application for&nbsp;remote configuration of&nbsp;robot electronic modules.
    Robots and&nbsp;other <strong>IoT</strong> devices often consist of&nbsp;complex control and&nbsp;measurement systems that require proper parameter settings for&nbsp;correct operation. Adjusting values and&nbsp;configuring systems is a&nbsp;tedious task that often requires halting the&nbsp;entire device and&nbsp;making a&nbsp;wired connection with&nbsp;a dedicated programmer.
</p>

<p>
    To address this, I developed the&nbsp;<strong>VBarWeb</strong> web application. The application server, installed on&nbsp;an onboard computer (or any other microcomputer controlling the&nbsp;device), acts as&nbsp;an intermediary between the&nbsp;user and&nbsp;the network of&nbsp;connected electronic modules. The application allows not only for&nbsp;quick, remote viewing of&nbsp;real-time sensor readings from the&nbsp;robot but&nbsp;also for&nbsp;configuring advanced equipment (e.g., changing the&nbsp;<strong>PID</strong> settings of&nbsp;motor controllers).
</p>

<p>
    Communication with&nbsp;the user is conducted over <strong>WiFi</strong>. Communication between the&nbsp;server and&nbsp;electronic modules occurs via the&nbsp;<strong>CAN bus</strong>, using a&nbsp;specially designed protocol. The application enables communication with&nbsp;any equipment that meets the&nbsp;communication requirements. The structure of&nbsp;its readings and&nbsp;settings is loaded using an&nbsp;<strong>XML</strong> file. The application also allows for&nbsp;the automation of&nbsp;repetitive tasks, such as&nbsp;setting default configurations across a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;robots.
</p>

<p>
    A full description of&nbsp;the project is included in&nbsp;my engineering thesis, which can be read <a href="/assets/files/inz.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="bold">here</a> (mostly in&nbsp;Polish).
